<b>CURATORIAL NOTE:</b>
Location: Haines Fall, Albany, New York
I clicked this picture during an international youth workshop titled, 'Nurture Your Being' at Peace Village Retreat and Learning Center in Upstate New York. This is a point of light,  where you can feel an "aura" of time, which eventually runs out. While focussing on it, it will appear normal; when you get immersed in the joy of meditating, the point of light freezes in time as your soul connects with the Supreme soul. This architectural marvel reminds of the Persian poet, Rumi who said: 

“Both light and shadow are the dance of Love.
Love has no cause, it is the astrolabe of God's secrets.
Lover and loving are inseparable and timeless"

<b>THE ARTIST:</b>
Dr. Sharma graduated from the Occupational Therapy School & Centre, Topiwala National Medical College, Mumbai. Previously he worked at Jai Vakeel School in Nashik, where he strengthened outreach efforts to students with special needs. Dr. Sharma’s liberal arts education through the Young India Fellowship opened up opportunities for a synchrony of theory and practice. He applied the learning gained through the fellowship to a community-based rehabilitation program for differently abled individuals as an Indicorps Fellow with Sahara, a grassroots organization in Odisha. His interests lie at the confluence of gifted education, diversity, accessible technology, and higher education policy.
