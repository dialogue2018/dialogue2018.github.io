Curatorial Note:
Location: Haines Fall, Albany, New York
I clicked this picture during an international youth workshop titled, 'Nurture Your Being' at Peace Village Retreat and Learning Center in Upstate New York. This is a point of light,  where you can feel an "aura" of time, which eventually runs out. While focussing on it, it will appear normal; when you get immersed in the joy of meditating, the point of light freezes in time as your soul connects with the Supreme soul. This architectural marvel reminds of the Persian poet, Rumi who said: 

“Both light and shadow are the dance of Love.
Love has no cause, it is the astrolabe of God's secrets.
Lover and loving are inseparable and timeless"

The Artist:
I am a senior year college student with an economics major. My name means creation and I try to live up to it through sketching. With a knack for hyperrealism, I continue to experiment with different mediums. I did my first ‘realistic’-like sketch in 11th grade and soon developed the curiosity to observe even the tiniest of the details in mundane things. 
Since am not formally trained as an artist, hit and trial has been my main mode of learning apart from the genetic benefit. Experimenting is crucial to the process of learning and knowing one’s own art according to me. This is my experiment to know mine better!
