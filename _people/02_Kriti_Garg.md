<b>THE ARTIST:</b>
<br />
I am currently associated as a Research Consultant with the University of Chicago for a project that is based in India. I worked as a Research Associate with Architect Sameep Padora before this. Prior to this, I completed my Young India Fellowship (A Liberal Studies programme which entails multi-disciplinary learning) from the Ashoka University in Sonepat, Haryana. Before this, I completed my B.Arch. from VNIT Nagpur in May 2014 and worked for 2 years in Ahmedabad (HCPDPM) and Mumbai (PK Das & Associates). Till date, I have couple of international publications and an opportunity for a public exhibition of my Bachelor's thesis.

<b>CURATORIAL NOTE:</b>
<br />
I began the journey to Latur on the pretext of reading about the severe water-less conditions of the people and farms in the Marathwada region. I felt the need to go out there, in the fields, on the ground and try to bring out their story. So, booked the tatkal train ticket from Mumbai to Latur and was off on a Friday night, post-office.  A small attempt towards documenting the plight of the drought affected regions of Marathwada area (mainly Latur, Kasarkheda, Harangul and Nagzari) of Maharashtra.
<br />
<br />
I reached Latur station early Saturday morning and knew I had just two days, with no fixed locations but a tentative agenda. It was around 8am and my first area of exploration began at Gandhi Putla chowk, which was one of the epicenters for collecting day-to-day water from the public tap. I met and interacted with the local karmacharis/ helpers and inquired about tanks. So each tank is of 6000 litres while they supply water (200 litres per family) in various wards, every 8 days.

Curatorial Note:
Delving into the simplicity of the mundane of life, Kriti's work reflects both simplicity and depth of how she sees her surroundings.

The Artist:
I am a senior year college student with an economics major. My name means creation and I try to live up to it through sketching. With a knack for hyperrealism, I continue to experiment with different mediums. I did my first ‘realistic’-like sketch in 11th grade and soon developed the curiosity to observe even the tiniest of the details in mundane things. 
Since am not formally trained as an artist, hit and trial has been my main mode of learning apart from the genetic benefit. Experimenting is crucial to the process of learning and knowing one’s own art according to me. This is my experiment to know mine better!
