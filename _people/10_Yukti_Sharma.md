<b>CURATORIAL NOTE:</b>
<br />
Tones of rawn emotions, introspection and uninhibited expressions are brought forth in Yukti's subtle, yet powerful artworks.


<b>ARTIST:</b>
<br />
When Yukti was 7, she would pen down letters to her grandmother and go to the post office with her Dad to post them. The feeling of receiving a letter back with chocolates and books was a joy unparalleled. It introduced her to the world of books, which was compounded by the fact that she comes from a family of Teachers. Born in Delhi, she grew up in 6 states nurturing versatility and adaptability. Candid & impetuous by birth, she is keen on all kinds of ventures that may come her way.
Having been a scholar her whole life, she opted for Engineering. While pursuing Electronics Engineering, she found herself immersed in Literary Events, Drama, Robotics, College Magazine and was recognized for excellence and outstanding efforts as an event manager.

She is passionate about animal welfare and you can frequently find her lending a hand in an animal shelter. She paints and loves to bake. You can also get a box of handmade delicious chocolates if she loves you much.
