Curatorial Note:
"Travel, not to reach a place but just for the sake of it. But remember that the devil is always in the details. For we can find ourselves only when we allow to be lost in the little moments around us. I intend to cherish these moments by capturing them. And when I look back, every frame tells me a story. This is my collection of short stories, of faces and places."
