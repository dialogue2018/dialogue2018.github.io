<b>ARTIST:</b>
<br />
Preena is an Economics graduate from the Shri Ram College of Commerce. With varied interests, she firmly believes in strong ideation and stronger execution. Independent and competitive, she likes wearing the creative hat. She possesses a 'getting things done' attitude when it comes to work, even if it is midnight. A risk-taker, a start-up enthusiast and a budding social entrepreneur, she loves to dream big. It was pretty early in her life when she realised that social entrepreneurship is what she is meant for. She has a strong tendency of relating instantly with people around, that reflects her capability in building strong bonds with people from diverse backgrounds she has worked with - artists, corporate professionals,entrepreneurs, and children.

She doesn't want people to shrink so they can squeeze themselves into small places and small minds. Grow. It's a big world. There's room, everyone will eventually fit.
