<b>CURATORIAL NOTE:</b>
<br />
Encasing journey's, Karan's viewfinder focusses on conglomerations of the everyday, and the reminants of friendship which permeate through the image.

<b>ARTIST:</b>
<br />
Bholenart is an exploration through the lens of lands travelled far and wide to conquer unimaginable dreams...and once conquered, resting on laurels is not for this photographer. Boundaries have been pushed rountinely in the repoirtoire of his artistic process.
