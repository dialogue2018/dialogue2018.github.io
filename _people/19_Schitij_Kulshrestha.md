<!--Title: <b>Multiple Titles</b>-->

<b>Curatorial Note:</b>
Representing Schitij at the Weekender (his words, not ours!), these works are an ode to his life in Bombay as it turn to Mumbai


<b>The Artist:</b>
If you still can’t spell his name correctly, we don’t blame you. Schitij earned many a nickname at the Fellowship but what remained constant was his love for sport. He took his passion to his ELM too and he did many cool things while being high. Our multi-talented man spearheaded several sporting initiatives on campus and got his hands dirty baking too! Jokes apart, anyone who knew Schitij came to know the wonderful, level-headed person he was, and the warmth he shared with the people whose paths he crossed. Schitij could have a really deep, thoughtful conversation one minute, and display an almost childlike love for food the next instant! Having built some strong bonds with fellows over the course of the Fellowship, Schitij moved to Mumbai to join NRB Bearings after YIF.
