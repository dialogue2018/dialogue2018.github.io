<b>CURATORIAL NOTE:</b>

While re-contextualising poetry and prose of yesteryear through the Daak initative, a need for solace and knowledge is satiated through Onaiza's handcrafted postcards

Onaiza Drabu is a recent graduate in anthropology from the University of Oxford. Her research focusses on identity and nationalism in Kashmir.

Before you ask, my name means the ‘first drop of dew’. It was only natural that I grew up to appreciate all things beautiful. Words, colours and shapes are how I see this world. You’ll find glimpses of these here. I am interested in a series of odd and disconnected things, but everything I capture in photographs or trap in words or colour in paintings has the connecting thread of beauty associated with it.
