<b>CURATORIAL NOTE:</b>
<br />
With a cross section of history and contemporary times through her engraving prints, Anitha, Dhriti and Nainy manage to create a socio-political dialogue

Dhriti Nadir will travel to the end of the world and back for architecture and food. In her 24 years on this dot, she has realized that she is constantly evolving, and learning and unlearning. Ergo, she is a million different people in this one lifetime. The constants are her sunny disposition, her love for early mornings, and her hunger (for food, knowledge, and adventure). She was in 8th standard when she decided to become an architect - and lo and behold, 10 years later, she is one! As a lover of goals and list-making, nothing makes her happier than checking things off her to-do list. But do not be fooled - a true creative leaves a trail of artsy destruction in their wake.

Describing herself as a spiritual extrovert, Anitha is a small town Indian girl with king-sized dreams, stuck in the roller coaster of life. With a crazily diverse background of being a native of Rajasthan, born in Hyderabad, brought up in Tamil Nadu, she has had the fortune of living and experiencing various cultures that has enriched her life immensely.
She has always had a bright academic background, bearing the titles of being a school and university topper at the district and state levels. On the other side, she believes education is not just in the books but in the experiences of life. To her, itâ€™s the planet and the people who together to make life beautiful

Nainy was selected for the Teach for India fellowship in the cohort of 2015. She was responsible for educating and holistic leadership training of 70 girls of standard 6th and 7th coming from low income background in a government school at Ambedkar Nagar, Delhi. During her fellowship, she managed Communications for a city wide project, Teach For India Delhi Model United Nations which impacted 1100 students across 18 schools. Nainy is a visionary and is passionate to work for causes that can bring about systemic change in the society. In order to understand education of a different set up, Nainy also interned with the Directorate of School Education of Jammu and Kashmir in one of the core areas of Kashmir. She worked with different stakeholders to fix the dilapidated structure of education system of one of the most affected area of India.
While she believes strongly in creating life through different experiences, she finds connection in her work through vision and people involved.
