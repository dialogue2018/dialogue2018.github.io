<b>CURATORIAL NOTE:</b>
<br />
Attention to detail underpins Anisha's artworks which are a combination of intricate patterns, overlapping of subliminal designs and edgy observations


<b>ARTIST:</b>
<br />
'Eternal light' - the meaning of her name truly defines the person she wants to become. Anisha, a cherisher of smiles, memories, and experiences, wishes to light up the world with happiness through her words which dance wildly to form poems and her drawings, which convey the art of love and contentment.

During her graduation, while making her way through microprocessors and algorithms, Anisha explored new horizons and tried to make the best of every opportunity that came her way. From being the President of the Computer Science Department to volunteering at Make A Difference, from winning creative writing competitions to being a member of the Entrepreneurship Cell of the college, from participating in an International Strategic Management and Marketing Programme at the Netherlands to being a part of the Dramatics Society; she learnt a lot and valued every bit of the crazy, lovely ride her college life was.
Being a night owl, she loves to greet sunrises, sketching all night and loving every twist and turn of her current mandala. She puts her heart in what she does and will fight for what she believes in, till the end.
