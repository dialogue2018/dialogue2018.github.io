<b>CURATORIAL NOTE:</b>
<br />
Consistently noticing the mundane and framing it in a context, Gaurav's vision captures even the most minute reverberation of floral life present right at our feet.

6. Christ first went to a place of joy. He who loves men, loves their joy. - Brother's Karamazov, Dostovesky
7. Why is the wee one crying, I want to make him happy. - Brother's Karamazov, Dostovesky
8. Against eternal injustice, man must assert justice, and to protest against the universe of grief, man must create happiness. - Camus

<b>THE ARTIST:</b>
<br />
My work helps me explore ideas through a personal narrative. The set of water color paintings came about while I was trying to express myself with simple lines. I was thinking about how color and lines can be used together. A main idea that I was following, was the accessibility of means like the game Blue Whale which takes people to an end. 
I was also reading Dostovesky, Milan Kundera and Camus while I was working of these set of paintings. I think ideas from these books also came into my work. So I have used some lines from Dostovesky and Camus's books as my titles.
