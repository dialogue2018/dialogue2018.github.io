<b>CURATORIAL NOTE:</b>
<br />
Consistently noticing the mundane and framing it in a context, Gaurav's vision captures even the most minute reverberation of floral life present right at our feet.

<b>THE ARTIST:</b>
<br />
My work helps me explore ideas through a personal narrative. The water color paintings came about while I was trying to express myself with simple lines. I was thinking about how color and lines can be used together. A main idea that I was following was the accessibility of means like the game Blue Whale, the phenomena on internet that leads teenagers to suicide. I find it connected with a broader idea of meaninglessness. These ideas are present in authors like Dostovesky, Milan Kundera and Albert Camus. Through my work I want to explore the growing narrative of meaninglessness and its implications. Also, what are the measures that can be used to counter it. 

I find nature as the source of all kind of forms. Through photography I am on a constant look out for beautifully formed compositions with fallen leaves, flowers and stems.
