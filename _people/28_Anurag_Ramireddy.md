Curatorial Note:
Use of bold colours and impressionistic brush strokes speak volumes about the uinhibited candor of Anurag's artwork


The Artist:
As a child, Anurag loved playing with colors; he exploited this passion for art and developed himself as a proficient and specialist oil painter. He is an ardent supporter of Manchester United and the Indian Cricket Team. His love for India, its politics, history and governance also developed at a young age and he hopes to further explore and broaden his knowledge in these fields during his time at the Fellowship.
He has a strong belief that people are a product of not only their own experiences but also the effect of society that they are a part of. Further, he believes that every interaction with an individual is unique and one can learn something from it. He trusts that the Fellowship will help him orchestrate his ideas and accentuate his skills to not only aid his personal growth but also help in societal progression.
