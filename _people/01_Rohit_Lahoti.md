CURATORIAL NOTE:
<br />
I began the journey to Latur on the pretext of reading about the severe water-less conditions of the people and farms in the Marathwada region. I felt the need to go out there, in the fields, on the ground and try to bring out their story. So, booked the tatkal train ticket from Mumbai to Latur and was off on a Friday night, post-office.  A small attempt towards documenting the plight of the drought affected regions of Marathwada area (mainly Latur, Kasarkheda, Harangul and Nagzari) of Maharashtra.
<br />
I reached Latur station early Saturday morning and knew I had just two days, with no fixed locations but a tentative agenda. It was around 8am and my first area of exploration began at Gandhi Putla chowk, which was one of the epicenters for collecting day-to-day water from the public tap. I met and interacted with the local karmacharis/ helpers and inquired about tanks. So each tank is of 6000 litres while they supply water (200 litres per family) in various wards, every 8 days.
