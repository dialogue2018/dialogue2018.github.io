<b>CURATORIAL NOTE:</b>
<br />
Symbols of faith, spirituality and hindusim have inspired the simple, yet beautiful works of Akshay

<b>ARTIST:</b>
<br />
Akshay arrived into the Fellowship after having finished his postgraduate studies from TISS. With extensive experience on the international platform through his participation in several global youth conferences, MUNs and summits, Akshay was always seen giving genuine compliments to the fellows and spreading warmth in the Fellowship in his own unique way. Upon some coaxing, you might have even found yourself listening to his renditions of old Bollywood melodies. If not busy travelling abroad to attend a conference, Akshay was found in deep conversations with a fellow or two and his slow, thoughtful words gave a glimpse into the warm, humble soul that he was.  His flair for the fine arts and willingness to welcome the unknown helped him embrace the wide array of opportunities that the Fellowship had to offer
