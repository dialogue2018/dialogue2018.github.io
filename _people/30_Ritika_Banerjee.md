<b>Curatorial Note:</b>
<br/>
Delving into the simplicity of the mundane of life, Kriti's work reflects both simplicity and depth of how she sees her surroundings.

<b>The Artist:</b>
<br/>
I am a senior year college student with an economics major. My name means creation and I try to live up to it through sketching. With a knack for hyperrealism, I continue to experiment with different mediums. I did my first ‘realistic’-like sketch in 11th grade and soon developed the curiosity to observe even the tiniest of the details in mundane things. 
Since am not formally trained as an artist, hit and trial has been my main mode of learning apart from the genetic benefit. Experimenting is crucial to the process of learning and knowing one’s own art according to me. This is my experiment to know mine better!
