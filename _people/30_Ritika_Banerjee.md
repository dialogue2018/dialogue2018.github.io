<b>Curatorial Note:</b>
<br/>
With aged quality, Ritika's work brings forgone era of nostalgic still photography and silver albumen back

<b>The Artist:</b>
<br/>
Writing is her weapon. Being an engineering student and being interested in competitive programming, she finds this liberal studies programme to be an important aspect of enabling her to develop a holistic growth module for herself. She wants to explore the origins of stereotypes, concepts of criminal psychology, tension points of politics, and religion. Documenting the truth and ideology of conflict zones and theatrical mastery through scriptwriting or acting - if all could be done, she would do it.

Favourite Quote: “Not all who wander are aimless. Especially not those who seek truth beyond tradition, beyond definition, beyond the image.”
