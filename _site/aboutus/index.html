  On 2nd June, the Ashoka Art Gallery on the 3rd floor of the New Academic Block at Ashoka, previewed the exhibition show titled ‘Dialogue’, to display the artistic talent of the Ashokan ecosystem at the Ashoka Alumni Weekender 3.0. It attempted to create an experience for viewers to tune into engaging with the thematic core of the show, through QR code enabled labels, next to each art-work. For some alums, this was a way to ‘be’ present, even if they weren’t physically attending the Weekender.  

On display were multiple mediums like soft pastel, poster paint, color pencil by Kriti Garg, whose work reflects both simplicity and depth of daily surroundings, complemented by a strong sense of seeking home, by Anisha Malhotra, Karan Bhola, Schitij Kulshrestha, Ritika Banerjee, Sanchet Sharma and Saloni Bagga. Adding the element of fire, Tatta Mohan and Shubrima Ghosh’s photographs beautifully contrast the peaks and valleys by Shivam Agarwal and Sourabh Tuwani. Keshav Goud and Gaurav Wadhawan reveal colors and horizons embedded in everyday sights, while our anonymous entry along with Samia Mahraj alludes to hidden meanings of pushing the conventional. Rohit Lahoti and Ritika Banerjee’s photographs question the very meaning of excess contrasted well by the sincerity on canvas through the acrylic colors of Yukti Sharma, Akshay Barik, Anurag Reddy, and Preena Gadra. Allowing water and air to engulf, the pen on paper renditions by Garima and an anonymous entry make us contemplate, while looking at Arpit Jain and Pia Bakshi’s abstract strokes speaking well with clay used by Gia Singh AroraASP2018 to mould struggling limbs. The reclaiming of history is felt through Daak postcards by Onaiza Drabu, and Goya’s subverted lithographs are in conversation with the socio-political landscape of contemporary India through the hard-hitting work by Anitha Choudhary, Dhriti Nadir and Nainy Katyal. All of this encases the show in a multiplicity of ‘Dialogue’s, at a time when less of it occurs in reality.

Particularly inspiring was Mandeep Singh’s work, the seminal art-work of the show. One cannot help but marvel at the ease with which shards of glass found on campus were tinted with color to form an almost poetic movement of a spiral - as if paused at mid-descent. Beautiful, but hard worn with painstaking effort - his work is symptomatic of the difficulty and ease of ‘dialoguing’ across perspectives to reach a meaningful platform. The art works in this show provided conversations across the intimately known landscapes - social, political, physical and mental, while re-claiming ‘histories’ across time and the mutating forms of the mundane everyday through different lenses. This exhibition was but one method of establishing a ‘Dialogue’ amongst many more yet to happen.
